# Microeconomics:
## Terminology:
1. *Opportunity Cost*: The cost of the next best alternative forgone in making the decision.
2. *Incremental Principle*: concept of how an additional units(Bulk) can impact the cost and benefit.
3. *Marginal Principle*: additional unit produced and how it will impact the business.
4. *Microeconomics*: Microeconomics is the study of the economic behavior of firms, and other micro organizations.
5. *Macro Economics:* Macro economics is analysis of national income, level of employment, price, consumption and investment at an aggregate level.

## Demand:
- The amount of quantity of a commodity are willing to or able to purchase at a given price and quantity. (Ceteris Paribus, other determinants kept at constant)
- Determinants:
	1. Nature of commodity.
	2. Availability of substitutes. (you can substitute coke for Pepsi)
	3. Income level
	4. Complimentary goods if any. (Petrol and car go hand in hand)
	5. Influence of habits.
- $D=f(price,income,habits)$
- Law of Demand: In general, as the price of a commodity increases, the  quantity demanded  for that commodity will decrease. (Negative relationship between price and quantity)

Point Elasticity:

Elasticity measured on a point on the curve. Let AB be the demand curve. At the center of AB, the demand is likely to be unitary elastic. Above, the mid-point, the demand will be elastic (>1), because the company has to decrease price to ensure increase in quantity demanded.


Price Elasticity:


$$
Price\hspace{2mm} Elasticity = \dfrac{Change\hspace{2mm}in\hspace{2mm}quantity\hspace{2mm}demanded\hspace{2mm}percentage}{Change\hspace{2mm}in\hspace{2mm}price\hspace{2mm}percentage}
$$
it will be negative, given the  function, but will use mod of it.
- if $e$=1,unitary elastic.
- if $e$<1,inelastic.
- if $e$>1,elastic.
- if $e$=0,perfectly elastic. (vertical line) $|$
- if $e$=$\infty$,perfectly elastic. (horizontal line) $-$

Income Elasticity of demand:

$$
Income\hspace{2mm} Elasticity = \dfrac{Change\hspace{2mm}in\hspace{2mm}quantity\hspace{2mm}demanded\hspace{2mm}percentage}{Change\hspace{2mm}in\hspace{2mm}Income\hspace{2mm}percentage}
$$
same levels of elasticity metrics as the price elasticity.
However, luxury will be more price elastic, and necessities will more  price inelastic.

Types of goods based on income:

- Inferior goods: Increase in income will lead to reduction of goods demanded and vice-versa. (negative slope) purchase lower quality and more commodity.
- Normal goods: Increase in income will lead to increase in goods demanded and vice versa. (Positive slope)

Cross Price elasticity:

$$
Price\hspace{2mm} Elasticity = \dfrac{Change\hspace{2mm}in\hspace{2mm}quantity\hspace{2mm}demanded\hspace{2mm}of \hspace{2mm}good1\hspace{2mm}percentage}{Change\hspace{2mm}in\hspace{2mm}price\hspace{2mm}of\hspace{2mm}good2\hspace{2mm}percentage}
$$


if $e$=0, unrelated goods.
if  $e$>0, substitutes.
if $e$<0, complimentary.

## Supply:

Law of Supply:
- The law of supply says that as the price of the commodity, the quantity supplied of that commodity also increases and vice versa. (Ceteris Paribus)
![[Drawing 2024-11-05 12.06.59.excalidraw.svg]]




Components affecting supply:
- price 
- technology
- cost of production
- policy on tax and subsidy

## Demand Forecasting:

Demand forecasting is a proactive process of finding the quantity customers are willing to purchase, when, where and what price. This becomes the foundation for the entire logistic process.

Components:
- Average
- Trend
- Cyclicity
- Elasticity

Methods of forecast:
- Survey of buyers intention
- Delphi method: asking a group of experts individually until a convergence happens in the discussion.
- Expert opinion: ask for number from them like quantity demanded, dealers etc
- collective opinion: take the estimates from the sales force based on territories.
- Time series method.
- Use of economic indicators.
- Controlled experiments
- Judgmental approach

---
## Other peripheral concepts.
- leading indicator:  a change in the leading indicator that will tell us the pattern of trends that will follow.
- Coincident indicator:
- Lagging indicator:


---
## Production Function:
$Q=f(labour,management,land,capital,technology)$ the independent var are also called the factors of production.

Short run: we can only change labor or only a single variable.

Long run: we can vary many other fixed parameters as well.

Levels of production:
- Increasing marginal returns
- Diminishing marginal returns.
- negative marginal returns.


Isoquant: 
The combination of two factors of production that will be required to produce the same level of output.

Can be used to talk about the tradeoff between capital intensive and labor intensive production.

marginal rate of technical substitution.
- rate of substitution between labor and machinery
- tells us that convex to the origin.


Relationship bw marginal, average and total costs.

other concepts: 
- Iso-cost line, 
- sunk costs,
- economic costs and accounting cost, 
- economic profit and accounting profit.
- cannibalization

## Market Structure:

1. Perfect competition
- Price taker
- easy entry and exit
- identical from one seller to another
- sellers are price takers
- products are identical in nature
- many buyer and sellers in the market.
- information flow is full and all are aware and make rational decisions.
- possible to have short term losses or super-normal profits, but will have normal profit in the long run. (refer the later diagrams)
- examples: vegetable market, groceries etc.

2.  Monopoly
- exclusive access to resources via ownership, patents, copyrights or licenses etc.
- mergers may lead to monopoly if market share become more than 25% as per CCI.
- e.g.: railways, satellite, defense etc.
- no easy entry or exit.
- not complete info known to all.
- not close substitutes to the product.

MC pricing:
since there is a difference between the difference between the quantity demanded and supplied, there is a market deficiency, the market demands, to solve this mc pricing is used. This happens when MC = price.

(graph will be attached at the end)

The difference in the area extended is called deadweight loss. (Market inefficiency)

Price discrimination:
selling to different consumers at different prices.
- first degree: different prices for different customers.
- second degree: different units at different price  to different buyers.
- third degree: divide markets into sub-markets and sell at different prices.

3. Oligopoly
- few sellers in the market
- homogenous oligopoly.
- differentiated oligopoly.
- interdependence
- advertisement
- competition
- entry and exit barriers
- lack of uniformity 

HHI:
$$
HHI = S_1^2+S_2^2......S_n^2
$$

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.

If $HHI\rightarrow0$, more smaller cycles
if HHI < 1500, unconcentrated.
if HHI < 2500, moderately concentrated.
if HHI > 2500, very concentrated.

(graph will be attached at the end)

4. Monopolistic competition:
- large number of firms.
- product differentiation
- easy entry and exit
- lack of perfect knowledge
- selling costs
- non pricing competition

Conclusions:
- monopsony: many sellers but less buyers. 
- oligopsony: few sellers but less buyers
