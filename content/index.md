## What's Blackbox?

- Interpretation 1: 
In planes, we would have heard about a box that will have all the messages, the pilot probably wanted to convey during his flight...(even if it reaches the air staff or not)..

- Interpretation 2:
A human mind is also a Blackbox(as per [[Marketing]]), it receives inputs, analyses them and makes decisions. Some tools for decision making are there in this Blackbox.

Sorry...No Gyan..

This Blackbox is a well structured format to store knowledge, thoughts and ideas, implementations and execution of plans or programs.

Basically, I was bored in class...

So thought of building this Blackbox...

To use this Blackbox:

> [!caution]
> You need Internet
